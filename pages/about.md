I received my PhD from Lund University, Sweden, in 2015. My doctoral thesis was titled "Flight Behaviour of Passerines on Nocturnal Migration" and I used small scale radars to individually track migrants, investigate their flight behavior and test predictions from optimal migration theory. My supervisor was Prof. Thomas Alerstam. 

After receiving my PhD I did a 1-year postdoc at [Vogelwarte Sempach](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/home/) in Switzerland. There I worked on extracting data on bird migration from the European weather radar network and making a migration flux analysis based on a subsample of radars as well as analyzing calibration results between weather radars and dedicated biological radars.

In 2017 I was awarded a Edward W. Rose Postdoctoral Fellowship and spent 2 years at the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home), Cornell University, USA. There I worked in the [BirdCast](https://birdcast.info) project, extracting and analyzing bird movement data from the US weather radar network, NEXRAD, working with eBird data and investigating continental scale patterns of bird migration and flight behavior.

Currently I am working as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie post doc fellow at the Center for Macroecology and Evolution at the University of Copenhagen. My current work includes large scale differences between migration systems, bird movements in extreme conditions, and what happens when birds and humans share aerial habitat.

I am part of the [GloBAM](https://globam.science) international network (see also [ENRAM](http://www.enram.eu)), working on improving the quality and access of weather radar data for biological research. 

My research is funded through the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement MigrationRadar No 844360.
