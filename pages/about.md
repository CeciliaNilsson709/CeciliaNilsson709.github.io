I received my PhD from Lund University, Sweden, in 2015. My doctorial thesis was titled "Flight Behaviour of Passerines on Nocturnal Migration" and I used small scale radars to individually track migrants, investigate their flight behavior and test predictions from optimal migration theory. My supervisor was Prof. Thomas Alerstam. 

After receiving my PhD I did a 1-year postdoc at Vogelvarte Sempach in Switzerland. There I worked on extracting data on bird migration from the European weather radar network and making a migration flux analysis based on a subsample of radars as well as analyzing calibration results between weather radars and dedicated biological radars.

In 2017 I was awarded a Edward W. Rose Postdoctoral Fellowship and spent 2 years at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Cornell University, USA. There I extracted and analyzed bird movement data from the US weather radar network, NEXRAD, and investigated continental scale patterns of bird migration and flight behavior.

Currently I am working as a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie post doc fellow at the Center for Macroecology and Evolution at the University of Copenhagen.

I am part of the [GloBAM](https://globam.science) international network,see also [ENRAM](http://www.enram.eu), working on improving the quality and access of weather radar data for biological research.
