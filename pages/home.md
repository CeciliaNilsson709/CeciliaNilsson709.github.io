I am a behavioral ecologist working with flight behavior, bird migration, and radar aeroecology. I currently work at the University of Copenhagen, where I study large scale patterns of flight behavior using data from networks of weather surveillance radars.
  
My current work includes large scale differences between migration systems, bird movements in extreme conditions, and what happens when birds and humans share aerial habitat.
