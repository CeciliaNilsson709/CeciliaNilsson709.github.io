I am a behavioral ecologist working with the flight behavior of birds, bird migration, and radar aeroecology. I currently work at the University of Copenhagen, where I study large scale patterns of bird flight behavior using data from networks of weather surveillance radars.
  
My current work includes large scale differences between migration systems, bird movements in extreme conditions, and what happens when birds and humans share aerial habitat.

My research is funded through the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement MigrationRadar No 844360.
