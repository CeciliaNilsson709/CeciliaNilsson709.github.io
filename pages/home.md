I am a behavioral ecologist working with flight behavior, bird migration, and radar aeroecology. I currently work at the University of Copenhagen, where I study large scale patterns of flight behavior using data from networks of weather surveillance radars. My current work includes large scale differences between migration systems, bird movements in extreme conditions, and what happens when birds and humans share aerial habitat.

I am part of the [GloBAM](https://globam.science) international network, previously [ENRAM](http://www.enram.eu), working on improving the quality and access of weather radar data for biological research. 

I received my PhD from Lund University, Sweden, in 2015. My doctorial thesis was titled "Flight Behaviour of Passerines on Nocturnal Migration" and I used small scale radars to individually track migrants, investigate their flight behavior and test predictions from optimal migration theory. My supervisor was Prof. Thomas Alerstam. 

After receiving my PhD I did a 1-year postdoc at Vogelvarte Sempach in Switzerland. There I worked on extracting data on bird migration from the European weather radar network and making a migration flux analysis based on a subsample of radars as well as analyzing calibration results between weather radars and dedicated biological radars.

In 2017 I was awarded a Edward W. Rose Postdoctoral Fellowship and spent 2 years at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Cornell University, USA. There I extracted and analyzed bird movement data from the US weather radar network, NEXRAD, and investigated continental scale patterns of bird migration and flight behavior.

Currently I am working as a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie post doc fellow at the Center for Macroecology and Evolution at the University of Copenhagen.
