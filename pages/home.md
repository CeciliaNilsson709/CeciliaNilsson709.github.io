I am a behavioral ecologist working with the flight behavior of birds, bird migration, and radar aeroecology. I currently work at Lund University, where I study large scale patterns of bird flight behavior using data from networks of weather surveillance radars.
  
My current work focuses on using weather radars to monitor biodiversity at large scales, differences between migration systems, bird movements in extreme conditions, and the conflicts that arise when birds and humans share aerial habitat.

My research is funded by [FORMAS](https://formas.se/en/start-page.html), the Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development.
